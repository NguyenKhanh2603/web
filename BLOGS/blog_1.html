                Today marks a milestone we once only dreamed of. Our paper has been accepted to The 16th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI-2026), co-located with the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2026) — one of the world’s most prestigious conferences in AI.
              </p>

              <p>
                EAAI is recognized as one of the largest and most respected symposia on AI and Education, providing a venue where educators and researchers come together to discuss how to teach AI more effectively, and how AI can enhance learning across all levels — from K-12 to postgraduate training. It celebrates innovative educational approaches that integrate AI and its many subfields — robotics, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision — while emphasizing creativity, pedagogy, and the human side of technology.
              </p>

              <p>
                The idea for our paper came from something deeply personal: the CSE Summer School, a short yet meaningful two-day program organized by the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). The event gathered selected high-school students from across Vietnam to explore the world of AI Agents — intelligent systems capable of reasoning, interacting, and adapting. During those two days, students attended lectures by leading experts, joined interactive networking sessions, and worked side-by-side in a hackathon to build their own question-answering systems powered by agentic reasoning. Though the program was short, it was unforgettable. There was excitement, frustration, laughter — and even quiet tears on the final day. Not from sadness, but from the realization that something truly meaningful had ended.
              </p>

              <p>
                We had set our sights on EAAI-2026 even before this year’s Summer School began. That goal gave us direction and purpose. Right after the event, we gathered reflections, redesigned materials, refined the system, and in just a few weeks, turned the experience into a full academic paper. Under the lead of Mr. Nguyen Song Thien Long and the supervision of Prof. Quan Thanh Tho, the experience became more than a project — it became a story about how inspiration in education can grow into real research.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, that paper has found its place at EAAI-26, within the AAAI-2026 Proceedings — an A*-ranked venue that bridges AI research and education worldwide. It’s more than an achievement. It’s a reminder that meaningful research doesn’t always start in a lab — sometimes, it begins in a classroom full of dreamers.
